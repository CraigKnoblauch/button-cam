# Buttons and pages
Each button corresponds to moving the camera to focus on a new primary camera.
The buttons also correspond to a group of 3d models. I specify that because of those dots on the side that I need. Those become highlighted when I'm looking at the group they correspond to. So I need a component that:
- adds a button to the header, and a dot on the side. 
- on button click the focus goes to the corresonding object
- When focus is on this component, there's a soft white color on the button and the dot
- when this component is not in focus, there's a translucent soft white color on the button and the dot 
- Scrolling advances to the next component
