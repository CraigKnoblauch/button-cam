# Button Cam
This repo serves as an exploration into directing a camera around a path based on user button clicks on the page. Very simple to a seasoned web developer I'm sure, but not to me.

The scope of this project includes the following requirements:

1. Show the user a simple scene that contains some 3d primitives
2. Have set camera positions for each primitive
3. Have little translucent dots on the side of the page that are vertically oriented and highlighted each time the corresponding primitive is shown 
4. Show the user 3 buttons on the top of the page. Pressing a button will cause the camera to ease into the corresponding camera position for that primitive
5. The camera will follow a path to view the primitives.
6. Progress the camera around the track with the scroll wheel if the user uses that instead of buttons
