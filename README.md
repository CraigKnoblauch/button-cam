# Button Cam
This repo serves as an exploration into directing a camera around a path based on user button clicks on the page. Very simple to a seasoned web developer I'm sure, but not to me.

The scope of this project includes the following requirements:

1. Show the user a simple scene that contains some groups of 3d primitives
2. Have set camera positions for each group primitive
3. Have a camera positionf for each primitive
3. Have little translucent dots on the side of the page that are vertically oriented and highlighted each time the corresponding primitive group is being shown
4. Show the user buttons for each group on the top of the page. Pressing a button will cause the camera to ease into the corresponding camera position for that primitive group.
5. The camera will follow a path between all the camera positions
6. Progress the camera around the track to all camera positions with the scroll wheel if the user uses that instead of buttons
